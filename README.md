# NLP to SQL Sales Data App

An automatic recipe generator is an innovative application that takes the ingredients available in your fridge and generates a list of recipe options that you can cook using those ingredients. The generator uses the Davinci API, which is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, to analyze the available ingredients and come up with a recipe suggestion that is both delicious and easy to make.

The Davinci API is trained on a vast corpus of text data and is capable of understanding natural language and generating human-like responses. This makes it the perfect tool for recipe generation, as it can analyze the ingredients and suggest recipes based on your preferences, dietary restrictions, and cooking skills.

To provide a visual representation of the recipe generated, the application also makes use of the DAlle API. This API uses deep learning techniques to generate high-quality images that are indistinguishable from real photographs. The DAlle API will generate an image of the recipe and present it alongside the recipe details, making it easier for you to visualize the final product and get a sense of what it will look like when you're done cooking.

Overall, the automatic recipe generator provides an efficient and convenient way to make use of the ingredients available in your fridge, and it is an excellent example of how artificial intelligence and deep learning can be used to enhance our daily lives.
